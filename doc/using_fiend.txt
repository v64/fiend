Examples:
Show the game boards for all your games:

from fiend import Fiend
f = Fiend('your-email@example.com', 'your-phone-id')
for id, games in f.games.iteritems():
    print id
    game.showBoard()

On Android, your phone ID can be found in Settings > About phone > Status > MEID. I haven't looked at the iPhone version yet, so I'm not sure what ID to use in that case.
